/**
 * An annotation for controlling the lifecycle of Long Running Actions (LRAs).
 *
 * The annotation SHOULD be applied to JAX-RS annotated methods otherwise
 * it MAY have no effect. The annotation determines whether or not the annotated
 * method will run in the context of an LRA and controls whether or not:
 *
 * - any incomming context should be suspended and if so if a new one should be started.
 * - to start an new LRA.
 * - to end any LRA context when the method ends.
 * - to throw an exception if there should be an LRA present on method entry.
 * - to throw an exception if the method returns particular HTTP status codes.
 *
 * Newly created LRAs are uniquely identified and the id is referred to as the
 * LRA context. The context is passed around using a JAX-RS request/response header
 * called {@link org.eclipse.microprofile.lra.client.LRAClient#LRA_HTTP_HEADER}.
 * The implementation (of the LRA specification) is expected to manage this context
 * and the application developer is expected to declaratively control the creation,
 * propagation and destruction of LRAs using the @LRA annotation. When a JAX-RS bean
 * method is invoked in the context of an LRA any JAX-RS client requests that it
 * performs will carry the same header so that the receiving resource knows that it
 * is inside an LRA context.
 *
 * If an LRA is propagated to a resource that is not annotated with any
 * particular LRA behaviour then the LRA will be suspended. But if this resource
 * then performs an outgoing JAX-RS request then the suspended LRA must be propagated
 * on this second outgoing request. For example, suppose resource A starts an LRA
 * and then performs a JAX-RS request to resource B which does not contain any LRA
 * annotations. If resource B then performs a JAX-RS request to a third service, C say,
 * which does contain LRA annotations then the LRA context started at A must be propagated
 * to C (for example if C uses LRAClient or annotations to join the LRA, then C must be
 * enlisted in the LRA that was started at A).
 *
 * Resource methods can access the LRA context id, if required, by injecting it via
 * the JAX-RS @HeaderParam annotation. This may be useful, for example, for
 * associating business work with an LRA.
