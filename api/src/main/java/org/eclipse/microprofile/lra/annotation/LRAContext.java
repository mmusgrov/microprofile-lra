/**
 * Participants that have joined an LRA will need the LRA context in order
 * to respond to {@link Compensate}, {@link Complete}, {@link Status} and
 * {@link Forget} requests. Similarly, business logic annotated with
 * the {@link LRA} annotation may need to know whether or not they have
 * been invoked with an active context. Methods marked with any of these
 * annotations can obtain the context by providing a method parameter of
 * type {@link org.eclipse.microprofile.lra.client.LRAId} markded with the
 * {@link LRAContext} annotation.
 *
 * Note that this is not the only way to obtain the current context.
 * Other mechanisms include {@link LRAClient#getCurrent()} and transport
 * specific techniques (for example a JAX-RS annotated resource it would
 * be appropriate to inject it via a HeaderParam).
