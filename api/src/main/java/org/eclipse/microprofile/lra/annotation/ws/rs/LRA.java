/**
 * <p>
 * An annotation for controlling the lifecycle of Long Running Actions (LRAs).
 *
 * <p>
 * The annotation <b>SHOULD</b> be applied to JAX-RS annotated methods otherwise
 * it <b>MAY</b> have no effect. The annotation determines whether or not the annotated
 * method will run in the context of an LRA and controls whether or not:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>any incoming context should be suspended and if so if a new one should be started</li>
 *   <li>to start a new LRA</li>
 *   <li>to end any LRA context when the method ends</li>
 *   <li>to throw an exception if there should be an LRA context present on method entry</li>
 *   <li>to cancel LRA context when the method returns particular HTTP status codes</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Newly created LRAs are uniquely identified and the id is referred to as the
 * LRA context. The context is passed around using a JAX-RS request/response header
 * called {@value #LRA_HTTP_HEADER}.
 * The implementation (of the LRA specification) is expected to manage this context
 * and the application developer is expected to declaratively control the creation,
 * propagation and destruction of LRAs using the {@link LRA} annotation. When a JAX-RS bean
 * method is invoked in the context of an LRA any JAX-RS client requests that it
 * performs will carry the same header so that the receiving resource knows that it
 * is inside an LRA context.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an LRA is propagated to a resource that is not annotated with any
 * particular LRA behaviour then the LRA will be suspended. But if this resource
 * then performs an outgoing JAX-RS request then the suspended LRA must be propagated
 * on this second outgoing request. For example, suppose resource <code>A</code> starts an LRA
 * and then performs a JAX-RS request to resource <code>B</code> which does not contain any LRA
 * annotations. If resource <code>B</code> then performs a JAX-RS request to a third service, <code>C</code> say,
 * which does contain LRA annotations then the LRA context started at <code>A</code> must be propagated
 * to <code>C</code> (for example if <code>C</code> uses an annotations to join the LRA,
 * then <code>C</code> must be enlisted in the LRA that was started at <code>A</code>).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Resource methods can access the LRA context id, if required, by injecting it via
 * the JAX-RS {@link HeaderParam} annotation. This may be useful, for example, for
 * associating business work with an LRA.
 * </p>
